# Helia Vehicle Module Implementation

Workflow

- Implement the following scripts:
 - `clean`: used to clean all the unnecessary code (e.g.: files generated by bundlers and package managers)
 - `build`: used to build the example
 - `start`: used to start the example
 - `test`: used to test the example
- The `README.md` must have (see example inside `example-template`):
  - Link to `Codesandbox.com` for one-click running demonstration
  - References for documentation/tutorials used to build the example
  - _Optional:_ Screenshots, gifs, etc... under `img/` folder
- Update the CI to run the tests of the new example as standalone
  - Edit `github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - Add the test name to `project` under `matrix`

#### Update `helia` to run tests against the repo

Open a PR to the [ipfs/helia](https://github.com/ipfs/helia) project that edits the `.github/workflows/examples.yml` in order to make sure a Helia release does not break your new example.

Search `.github/workflows/test.yml` for the `test-examples` section and add a block at the end of the `example` matrix key similar to:

```yml
- name: my super fun new example
  repo: https://github.com/ipfs-examples/helia-my-super-fun-new-example.git
  deps: helia@$PWD/packages/helia/dist
```

The value of the `deps` key will vary depending on which modules from helia your example uses. Above we override the `helia` module, but your example may different deps.

Please see the existing setup in `.github/workflows/test.yml` for how to ensure you are overriding the correct modules.

The IPFS implementation in JavaScript needs your help! There are a few things you can do right now to help out:

Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and [JavaScript Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_JS.md).

- **Check out existing issues** The [issue list](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/issues) has many that are marked as ['help wanted'](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or ['difficulty:easy'](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Adifficulty%3Aeasy) which make great starting points for development, many of which can be tackled with no prior IPFS knowledge
- **Look at the [Helia Roadmap](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)** This are the high priority items being worked on right now
- **Perform code reviews** More eyes will help
  a. speed the project along
  b. ensure quality, and
  c. reduce possible future bugs
- **Add tests**. There can never be enough tests
