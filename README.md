# EtherMonitor
Monitoring tools for road incident management and reducing traffic congestion. Crowdsourcing information sharing for better and safer roads using ASDI OpenAQ dataset.

Goal: Effective design, engineering and delivery of Ethereum blockchain technology aided solution for vehicles and citizens to make roads safer and better for everyone using predictive analytics and automation. 

Solution: Technical solution for citizens, police officers and drivers to report and manage incidents, detect and prevent accidents on web and mobile.

Amazon ASDI OpenAQ initiative: This project utilizes AirQualityQuotient (AQQ) Tool build using "Amazon ASDI OpenAQ" dataset and maps it with road incident manager for early detection and prediction of road incidents, reduce traffic congestion in areas of low visibility.

Details: We have developed a road incident management system using Javascript, HTML5, SAP's UI5 on the front end using Livepeer open source video streaming system and crowdsourcing marketplace using Zora's auction house template for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and control powered by Ethercalc (SocialCalc), Zora, Polygon, NFT.Storage, ethpass, Litprotocol for security and neume for data retrieval and live peer for online video streaming at the road incident spot for better coordination and immediate action.
How it works:
1. Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with Livepeer, NFT.Storage for snapshots of road incident, ethpass for toll ticketing, neume for data retrieval.
2. Object Detection using Livepeer and Pytorch/Tensorflow deep learning library using CNN neural networks.
3.  Video analytics configuration using NFT.Storage, Litprotocol for security and neume for data retrieval.
4. Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using Livepeer for streaming, Litprotocol for security and NFT.Storage for snapshots.
5. Alarm storage using Ethereum. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. Store the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using  NFT.Storage, Litprotocol for security and neume for data retrieval.. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.
6. Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch.
Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page.
Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone.
You can also delete an existing alarm.
We are using Zora's Auction House template for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction.
We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock.
We are using DAOtooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.

Zora auction house template and v3 modules:
We are developing a crowdsourcing marketplace using Zora's auction house template for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and control. We are using the zora starter kit to access  ZORA API, Creator Toolkit, and Marketplace Hyperstructure. Zora's Auction House template is being utilized for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction.
We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock.
We are using DAOtooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.

NFT.Storage:
We are using NFT.Storage  for storing a variety of offchain data like incident snapshots, alarm metadata and object types at the time of incident. Please find the video at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lxeHbPzLoF0DzDZkh9N7Z_5aTKjmdEza (screencapturewithoutsound.mov file). We are storing Alarm metadata using NFT.Storage. Also, Saving/deleting alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. We are also storing the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using  NFT.Storage.
 Further we are using NFT.Storage for: Video analytics configuration using NFT.Storage; Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with Livepeer, NFT.Storage; Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using Livepeer for streaming, and NFT.Storage for snapshots.

Livepeer: 
We are using Livepeer as the key infrastructure provider for online video streaming of critical road incidents ( Please find the video at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lxeHbPzLoF0DzDZkh9N7Z_5aTKjmdEza (screencapturewithoutsound.mov file and roadincidentmanagement.mp4)). We are using Livepeer at: Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using Livepeer for streaming; Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with Livepeer.

Neume:
We are using neume recording audio based incidents where video is not possible to record. This will enable us to develop a socially scalable and open-source metadata retrieval, indexing, and management infrastructure for decentralized road incident management. Bandwidth is a major issue in India and neume protocol fits right at the spot for quick data retrieval where video is not possible due to high latency or unavailability of network for video streaming.

Spinamp:
We are trying to utilize Spinamp for audio streaming road incidents where video streaming is not possible to implement. Bandwidth is a major issue in India and Spinamp fits right at the spot for quick data retrieval where video is not possible due to high latency or unavailability of network for video streaming.
