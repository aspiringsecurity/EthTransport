# EthTransport
Monitoring tools for road incident management and reducing traffic congestion. Crowdsourcing information sharing for better and safer roads.

Goal: Effective design, engineering and delivery of IPFS storage and Ethereum, Tron blockchain technology aided solution for vehicles and citizens to make roads safer and better for everyone using predictive analytics, automation, Ethereum and Tron eco-system tools.. 

Solution: Technical solution for citizens, police officers and drivers to report and manage incidents, detect and prevent accidents on web and mobile.

Landing Website: https://sites.google.com/view/aspiring-road-safety/home

Details: We have developed a road incident management system using Javascript, HTML5, SAP's UI5 on the front end using open source video streaming system, Covalent API end points, IPFS and Filecoin, Tron's BTTC blockchain. We are starting an express server and storing data on the Filecoin Network for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and control. Our solution is powered by Ethercalc (SocialCalc), Zora, Polygon NFT.Storage, Tableland, XMTP, Chainlink, Fluence, Litprotocol for security and live peer for online video streaming at the road incident spot for better coordination and immediate action.

How it works:

1. Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras for snapshots of road incident.

2. Object Detection using open source computer vision.

3. Video analytics configuration using IPFS.

4. Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics saving IPFS for screenshots.

5. Alarm storage using Ethereum. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS. Store the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.

6. Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm.

Tron's BTTC blockchain: We are using DAOtooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms using Tron DAO. Please visit https://github.com/seetadev/EtherMonitor/tree/main/zoracommunitymarketplace/tron-contracts

Learning and Contributing in the Blockchain Eco-systems:

1.a. NFTPort Dashboard: We are using NFTPort to see all NFTs from different networks. This enables drivers, citizens, police officers and administrators to:

- View their NFTs in different network when they enter their address and select the network such as Ethereum, Polygon (Matic), Avalanche, and Binance Smart Chain

- View the contract of the NFT such as floor price, unique token ids sold today, gas quote rate day, and list of NFTs minted

Please visit: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/BillingTool/NFT-Dashboard-NFTPort


b. Polygon: We are utilizing ZoraModuleManager, and ZoraProtocolFeeSettings in our our dapp and deploying it on Polygon after registering the Zora market module. Please visit: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/alarmviewer

Please find the video at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1vo_ZnHzqYwd7lDaZKGSXev3Vvya7DjJT (screencapturewithoutsound.mov file under Mobile Screen capture directory).

We are using the zora starter kit to access ZORA API, Creator Toolkit, and Marketplace Hyperstructure. Zora's Auction House template is being utilized for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction. We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock. We are using DAOtooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.


c. Lit : We are using Lit protocol to automate signing, reading, and writing road incident metadata (snapshots) and alarm viewer data to web3 decentralized networks (Ethereum and IPFS).

- Lit Access Control: Lit Protocol Oauth to Enable faster login for 5 different personas. The 5 different personas: Citizen, Police officer, dispatcher, admin, government roles can easily be authenticated and logged in so that they can use their Ethereum address. Please visit: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/incidentandalarmstorage/Lit-Access-Control-Google-OAuth

2. a IPFS's web3ui storage: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/roadincidentmanagement/w3ui-incident-storage
We are using web3ui Storage  for storing a variety of offchain data like incident snapshots, alarm metadata and object types at the time of incident. Please find the video at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lxeHbPzLoF0DzDZkh9N7Z_5aTKjmdEza (screencapturewithoutsound.mov file). We are storing Alarm metadata using web3ui.Storage. Also, Saving/deleting alarm metadata and image to/from Filecoin, IPFS using web3ui.Storage. We are also storing the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using web3ui.Storage.
 Further we are using web3ui.Storage for: Video analytics configuration using web3ui.Storage; Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with Livepeer, NFT.Storage; Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using Livepeer for streaming, and web3ui.Storage for snapshots.

NFT.Storage for Filecoin: We are also learning to use NFT.Storage: Please visit https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/incidentandalarmstorage

9. Chainlink: We are extending and adapting the Chainlink project "Link My Ride" to develop a decentralized first aid and ambulance platform by using Chainlink External Adapter to connect a Tesla Vehicle API to a Chainlink oracle for a peer-to-peer vehicle rental app. We wish to use it for Maruti Vehicle API and Hyundai Vehicle API too. Please visit: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/decentralized-ambulance

We are utilizing Chainlink VRF as follows:

E-Challan (Transport Receipt) Bill Generation: We are utilizing Chainlink Mix to work with Chainlink smart contracts. The bill script will deploy a smart contract to goerli and get a Random number via Chainlink VRF, which can used to identify a unique transaction/order number for the receipt or bill. Link: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/roadincidentmanagement/IPFS-Chainlink-Monitor-main

Parametric Insurance Solution in public transportation especially for project finance. We are utilizing an existing example at chainlink github repo to develop an insurance solution for public transportation. Link: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/roadincidentmanagement


10. Covalent API end Points: We are using Covalent to see all NFTs for NFC tags of vehicles across different networks. Further, we have the following Covalent end-points APIs:

Get Log Events by Contract Address: to get log events like sold/listed nft for NFC tags/NFC Tags of vehicles on marketplace. 

Get Log Events by Incident Types: to get log data for specific incident event along with its metadata

Get NFT External Metadata: To get metadata for NFT like attribute and snapshot images.

Get Historical Token Prices: To get price of token for currency that accept NFT/item on marketplace.


We are developing a Transport DAO platform using Covalent that enables fleet providers, cab aggregators and corporate organizations to keep track of all the details of their Transport assets, vehicle assets, DeFi investments, transactions, and assets across all multiple chains and also displays DAO data using a data visualization chart. We are building our solution on top of an existing web3 dashboard system and are planning to integrate it with an analytics, tabulation and collaboration tool namely EtherCalc. Please visit: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/Covalent-Dashboard

Web3 Car Parts Dashboard powered by Covalent is a DAO platform that enables Transport Ministry and third party service and repair organizations to keep track of all the details of their transport assets, DeFi investments, transactions, and assets across all multiple chains and also displays DAO data using a data visualization chart. We are building our solution on top of an existing web3 dashboard system and are planning to integrate an analytics, tabulation and collaboration tool namely EtherCalc.
