# EthTransport
Monitoring tools for road incident management and reducing traffic congestion. Crowdsourcing information sharing for better and safer roads.

Goal: Effective design, engineering and delivery of Ethereum blockchain technology aided solution for vehicles and citizens to make roads safer and better for everyone using predictive analytics and automation. 

Solution: Technical solution for citizens, police officers and drivers to report and manage incidents, detect and prevent accidents on web and mobile.

Smart contracts and implementation for Harmony Marketplace.

Harmony Vizualizing and Analytics Tool: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/harmony-blockchain/viz-anaytics-tool

We are developing an open source vizualization tool to enable tabulation, charting, organization and graphing of data.

Details: We have developed a road incident management system using Javascript, HTML5, SAP's UI5 on the front end using Livepeer open source video streaming system. We are starting an express server and storing data on the Filecoin Network for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and control. Our solution is powered by Ethercalc (SocialCalc), Zora, Polygon NFT.Storage, Tableland, XMTP, Chainlink, Fluence, Litprotocol for security and live peer for online video streaming at the road incident spot for better coordination and immediate action.

How it works:
1. Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with Livepeer, NFT.Storage for snapshots of road incident, ethpass for toll ticketing, neume for data retrieval.
2. Object Detection using Livepeer and Pytorch/Tensorflow deep learning library using CNN neural networks.
3.  Video analytics configuration using NFT.Storage, Litprotocol for security and neume for data retrieval.
4. Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using Livepeer for streaming, Litprotocol for security and NFT.Storage for snapshots.
5. Alarm storage using Ethereum. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. Store the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using  NFT.Storage, Litprotocol for security and neume for data retrieval.. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.
6. Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch.
Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page.
Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone.
You can also delete an existing alarm.

Moralis: We are using the Medium Clone example to develop a dashboard and newsletter structure for recording the weekly minutes of the meeting. Please visit the module link: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/Medium-Meeting-Reports

Deployment URL: https://3gtivnurtulj.usemoralis.com:2053/server (to be deployed to moralis)

Learning and Contributing in the Moralis Partner Eco-systems:

1. Polygon: We are utilizing ZoraModuleManager, and ZoraProtocolFeeSettings in our our dapp and deploying it on Polygon after registering the Zora market module. Please visit: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/alarmviewer

2. NFT.Storage for Filecoin:
We are using NFT.Storage  for storing a variety of offchain data like incident snapshots, alarm metadata and object types at the time of incident. Please find the video at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lxeHbPzLoF0DzDZkh9N7Z_5aTKjmdEza (screencapturewithoutsound.mov file). We are storing Alarm metadata using NFT.Storage. Also, Saving/deleting alarm metadata and image to/from Filecoin, IPFS using NFT.Storage. We are also storing the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using  NFT.Storage.
 Further we are using NFT.Storage for: Video analytics configuration using NFT.Storage; Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with Livepeer, NFT.Storage; Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using Livepeer for streaming, and NFT.Storage for snapshots.

 3. Tableland: We are using Tableland for implementing incident notes maintained by transport administrators. Please visit Incident Notes powered by Tableland at https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/incidentnotestableland/incidentnotes
 
 4. XMTP: We are implementing XMTP Chat for Transport administrators in a particular region with CyberConnect functions. Please visit the implementation link: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/XMTPChat-with-cyberconnect
 
 Please also visit XMTP integrations with the platform:
 
 a. https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/xmtp-loc-chat
 
 b. https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/xmtp-messaging


5. Fluence: We are using Fluence to develop a counter for road incidents reported by citizens and complains resolved by police authorities in a specific region which could be shared across citizens and government authorities. Our impact solution for citizens create a positive societal behavior and can be used for availing tax benefits, citizen rewards and ecommerce gift cards by Ministry of Road and Transportation.

6. Chainlink: We are extending and adapting the Chainlink project "Link My Ride" to develop a decentralized first aid and ambulance platform by using Chainlink External Adapter to connect a Tesla Vehicle API to a Chainlink oracle for a peer-to-peer vehicle rental app. We wish to use it for Maruti Vehicle API and Hyundai Vehicle API too.
