                    By accessing or using the Site, you accept and assume certain inherent features related to
                    engaging in recording the data on the blockchain. Interactions with the Lens Protocol rely
                    on smart contracts stored on a publicly available blockchain, cryptographic tokens
                    generated by the smart contracts, and other nascent software, applications and systems
                    that interact with blockchain-based networks. One of the defining features of blockchain
                    technology is that its entries are immutable, which means, as a technical matter, they
                    generally cannot be deleted or modified by anyone. If you are not comfortable assuming the
                    inherently immutable and public nature of all entries on the blockchain, you should not
                    engage with our Site.
