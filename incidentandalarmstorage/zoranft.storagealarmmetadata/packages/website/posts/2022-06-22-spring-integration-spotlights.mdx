2022 is flying fast! In Q2, the NFT.Storage team brought you the [NFTUp easy uploader](https://nft.storage/blog/post/2022-04-05-announcing-nftup/), [SuperHot Gateway perma-caching](https://nft.storage/blog/post/2022-05-24-superhot-gateway-announcement/), and more. We've also been heads down getting ready to roll out huge improvements to upload reliability and read latency for early Q3 while also crossing 68M uploads as a service! But the momentum doesn't stop there – continue reading to learn about some exciting NFT.Storage integrations from the past few months as we highlight a few of the amazing projects that are building on top of IPFS and Filecoin, aiming to change the way we interact with the web day-to-day.

The Dvision Network is a blockchain-based NFT metaverse platform. The Dvision Network establishes a new format of metaverse ecosystem that utilizes its own VR technology and aims to lower the entry barriers for users across the globe. 

The need for a resilient system to store NFT data and mitigate the risk of data manipulation is paramount. Therefore, NFT.storage x Dvision Network integration came about to help the 2 billion gamers worldwide who have collected digital items and need the same assurances that these digital items will be protected and exist, regardless of the existence of any single institution. NFT.Storage provides data immutability for Dvision NFT metadata, enhanced data storage privacy, and better overall security. All Dvision Network NFT metadata will be stored using NFT.Storage such as LAND, PET, Avatar, and ITEM.

## Limewire

LimeWire is back to bring NFT collectibles to everybody\.

LimeWire aims to let everyone participate in owning and offering digital collectibles no matter the budget or tech-savviness. A key component of their vision is to make the whole process as frictionless and safe as possible for our users. LimeWire is designed as a custodial marketplace: Every user has by default a wallet for cryptocurrencies as well as digital collectibles (NFTs) that LimeWire will be hosting for them. NFTs will both be stored by us on their system, alongside NFT.Storage, creating additional layers of redundancy, and securing the storage of the NFT assets.

“The LimeWire team has been incredibly thoughtful in how to balance Web2 and Web3 - to make the benefits of NFTs accessible to creators and their audiences without forcing them to become experts on Web3 overnight. We’re excited to be partnering with them to help ensure all NFTs are stored and persisted on decentralized storage networks,” says Jonathan Victor, BD Lead at NFT.Storage.

## Label Foundation

Creators often wonder - is there a way to easily create and utilize the content on the web without being an IP law expert?

LABEL is a blockchain-based, NFT copyright fee-sharing platform that introduces an incubation system that supports investment, distribution, and promotion processes to break down high barriers to existing content production, aiming to dismantle the current unfair profit distribution structure. Label Foundation collaborates with NFT.Storage to ensure the resilience of their NFT Marketplace.

# More to come in Q3!
The second half of 2022 will bring additional performance improvements, a new, easy-to-use web upload UX, and deeper integration of decentralized protocols like UCAN and IPNS.
